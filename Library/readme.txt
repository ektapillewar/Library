Library Management System - Frontend
As My Project is a Frontend Project so I have not hosted it.

The Library Management System is a web application designed to facilitate the management and organization of a library's collection of books. It provides features for both library staff and patrons to interact with the system efficiently. The system comprises four main sections: Library Sign In, Sign Up, Book Store, and Book Categories.

Technologies Used
The Library Management System is built using the following technologies:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (including external libraries such as Font Awesome)
